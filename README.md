# DocFind â€“ Doctor Booking App

DocFind is a simple doctor-booking app designed to practice routing, UI design, and dynamic content rendering. Built using React, React Router, and Tailwind CSS, this project aims to demonstrate my front-end development skills through a fully interactive and dynamic user interface.

## Features

- Browse Doctor Profiles: Users can view doctor profiles with relevant details.

- Book Appointments: Users can select doctors and attempt to book appointments (currently displays a placeholder error message).

- Dynamic Content Rendering: Content is dynamically rendered based on user interactions.

- Error Handling: Basic error handling for the appointment booking feature.

- Modals & Dynamic Pages: Implemented modals and dynamic pages to showcase interactive UI components.

## Tech Stack

- React: For building the user interface.

- React Router: For handling routing and navigation between pages.

- Tailwind CSS: For styling and ensuring a responsive layout.
